I'm a PhD candidate in Artificial Intelligence at the University of Isfahan, Iran, and a researcher at the Medical Image Analysis & Artificial Intelligence (MIAAI) group at Danube Private University, Austria. My research focuses on content-based medical image retrieval using graph neural networks, histopathology image analysis, and foundation models. I'm passionate about applying AI to healthcare and have experience in both academic and industrial settings.
